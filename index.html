                                <p>I worked at the company, Future Generation System, which is a small company involved in Data processing. My work involved developing a chat client to be used by the employees of the company. It was an amazing experience
                                    to work on a project from scratch to completion. My co-workers were very welcoming and were ready to help me out whenever I had an issue. The members of the receiving LC were very warm and I got the opportunity to make
                                    a lot of friends with the other interns that LC Yildiz was hosting.

                                <p>I did my internship in my final year, just before I joined a corporate job. I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better experience. I got to meet lots of people from all across the globe. From these people, I got to know a lot about
                                    their culture, their perception on various things and even cuisines! Moreover, living in a foreign land and truly experiencing the lifestyle is so much better than just travelling there for a few days. I thank IAESTE
                                    for giving me this opportunity which I will embrace all my life.

                                <p>I was interning as a computer science engineer with Acoustics and Vibrations Research Group at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium. Brussels is the central city of Belgium. Hence it was quite easy for me to travel to other
                                    countries like Netherlands (Amsterdam), France (Paris), Germany(Cologne), Switzerland (Zurich, Lucerne, and Rhine fall) and other towns of Belgium like Ghent and Brugge in the weekends. I'd like to thank IAESTE LC Manipal
                                    for giving me this wonderful opportunity and for all the help for making my internship experience successful.

                                <p>My IAESTE Internship was priceless , the main benefits came down to three elements. First, feeling incredibly grateful and proud to work with very respectful and sweet Japanese students and professors was a gift in itself.
                                    Second, visiting the wonders of Japan, it is just impossible not to be in awe with all the beauty and culture the country has to offer. Finally, meeting intelligent, creative and well-rounded fellow interns from all
                                    over the United States, Europe and South America.

                                <p>I interned at Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology in Ilmenau, Germany. The main focus of the institute is on Audio-Visual data and I'm working with the Audio Forensics group! During this internship, I learnt
                                    a lot along the way! My supervisor and the whole team were extremely helpful and welcoming! Theyâ€™ve also often, very kindly, offered to translate the German food menu in the food court during lunch for me and invite
                                    me to department barbecues! I was really fortunate to have experienced their college fest in the first week of my internship.

                                <p>I interned at Medical University of Lodz, Poland. I worked with a very understanding and supportive supervisor. This was my first experience in Research and it taught me to be calm, patient and passionate about my research
                                    work. I made a lot of friends from different countries. During the weekends, I visited different cities of Poland like Warsaw and Krakow, and was amazed to know the long and rich history of Poland. Besides visiting
                                    Polish cities, I also travelled to Vienna during my last weekend which gave me great insight into European culture. My IAESTE Internship was honestly, the best thing I have ever done!
